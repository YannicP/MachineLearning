# MachineLearning

This repository contains various projects on <b>Machine Learning</b> and will be updated with more.

- Predicting Housing Prices using a Linear Regression Model: This project uses scikit-learn to build a model for predicting housing prices. 
  This is accomplished by feature engineering, appropriate feature selection. Afterwards different validation methods are used to determine
  the models accuracy - holdout validation, cross validation and lastly K-Fold cross validation.
  
- Predicting Car Prices: This project tries to predict accurate pricing of cars based on different features such as horsepower, miles per gallon and others. To make predictions, a K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm was used.
