This repository contains various projects on <b>Machine Learning</b> and will be updated with more.

- Predicting Housing Prices using a Linear Regression Model: This project uses scikit-learn to build a model for predicting housing prices. 
  This is accomplished by feature engineering, appropriate feature selection. Afterwards different validation methods are used to determine
  the models accuracy - holdout validation, cross validation and lastly K-Fold cross validation.
